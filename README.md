# node-farm-project
The main goal of this project is to grasp principals of nodejs, since I'm taking Jonas course on Udemy (Backend Development)

# Concepts not to be ignored building this armazing project

Node is single thread unlike other langs such as: PHP, Python and Java
which essentially means you must think carefully in your design as you build your apps
to not block the code, nodejs was also build on philosophy of callbacks, and helps you
write your code smoothly on your entire stack using the same lang (JavaScript).

performance and scalability are guaranteed with nodejs...

# What I have learnt in this small project

1. Find all code information in nodejs docummentation
2. The differences in writing blocking (synchronous) and non-blocking (asynchronous) code,
and when exactly to use each
3. Where to locate core modules and how to write mine
4. How to avoid callbacks hell
5. To deal with status code to inform the client side what to expect
6. How to deals with file system, routings, and (very importantly) build html templates
   and fill them with data coming from API.
7. I've figured out how 'map function' function.
8. I've also understood: How to deal with both requests (coming from client side) and responses (server side).
9. I have combined all this knowledge and i built
